                        <option value="lis"><b>This is the second item's accordion body.</b> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds <br>the appropriate classes that we use style each element. These classes control the overall <br>appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with <br>custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML <br>can go within the <span>.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow.</option>
